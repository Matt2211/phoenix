  questions: [
    {
      question: 'How does CBT work?',
      answer:
        'CBT is a structured, time-limited therapeutic approach that focuses on the relationship between thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. CBT works by helping you become aware of negative or distorted thinking patterns that may be contributing to emotional distress or unhelpful behaviors. CBT is a collaborative process, where you and your therapist work together to achieve your goals.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I know if therapy is right for me?',
      answer:
        "CBT is highly effective for a variety of conditions, including but not limited to anxiety disorders (e.g., Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Social Anxiety, OCD), depression and trauma. If you're looking for practical tools to manage your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, CBT is likely a good fit. It's especially effective for those who are motivated to work on changing their thought patterns and behaviors. I also draw on other therapeutic modalities such as ACT and CFT to make our approach flexible and tailored to your needs. Please consult my ‘Therapy areas' section to see which conditions I help people with. If you're unsure if CBT is right for your situation, we can discuss your concerns in a consultation to determine the best approach for you.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Is therapy only for people with mental health conditions?',
      answer:
        'Therapy is for anyone who might be facing a difficult time. It can be beneficial for anyone looking to improve their mental well-being, manage stress, build better habits, and improve self-esteem.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How many sessions do I need?',
      answer:
        'The length of CBT varies depending on the individual and the issue being addressed. Typically, CBT is a short-term therapy, lasting anywhere from 6 to 20 sessions.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will CBT involve some work outside our sessions?',
      answer:
        "One key aspect of CBT is that it often includes tasks or exercises between sessions. These help you practice new skills and apply what you've learned in everyday life. This “homework” is an essential part of CBT, as it accelerates progress and supports lasting, meaningful change.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to talk about my past in therapy?',
      answer:
        "You decide what to share, there's no pressure. My therapy mainly focuses on how your current thoughts and behaviours affect your wellbeing (‘the here-and-now'). However, exploring past experiences can sometimes help understand your core beliefs and how they influence the patterns you're experiencing today, especially if you suffered psychological trauma.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Will I feel upset during sessions?',
      answer:
        "It's possible that you may feel upset during some sessions, and that's completely normal. Starting therapy often means talking about thoughts, emotions, or experiences that you've been carrying for a long time. Feeling emotional is not a sign of weakness, nor is it an indication that therapy isn't right for you. In fact, these moments often signal that you're touching on areas where real growth can happen. Sometimes things feel a bit harder before they begin to feel easier. You will always have support during this process, and your therapist will help you move at a pace that feels safe and manageable.",
    },
    {
      question: 'How do free consultations work?',
      answer:
        'A 15 minute phone consultation is an informal opportunity to introduce each other, ask questions and get some insight into your difficulties. This will only be a brief conversation that will not replace a formal therapy assessment.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I prepare for my first session?',
      answer:
        "No specific preparation is needed. Just make sure you have your device ready for video calls and that you have a working webcam and microphone. It can be helpful to take a little time before your session to reflect on the issues you'd like to address, your goals for therapy, and any questions you may have. As part of best clinical practice, I will also ask for your GP's details and a next of kin (NOK) or emergency contact. Sharing this information is not compulsory, however, it can be important in rare situations where serious clinical risks arise and additional support is needed to keep you safe. We will always discuss this sensitively, and your information will be stored securely and used only when necessary.",
    },
    {
      question: 'Is online CBT effective?',
      answer:
        'Yes! CBT can be effectively conducted online, and research shows that it can be as effective as in person therapy. Online therapy is especially convenient for those with busy schedules or who prefer the flexibility of remote sessions, without the need to worry about travel, traffic, or parking. Just make sure you have a private, comfortable space for your session.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Can I cancel a session after booking?',
      answer:
        "Yes, you can cancel your session free of charge with at least 24 hours' notice. Please refer to this link to learn more about cancellation policy. Payment for sessions is collected in advance, and appointments can only be confirmed once payment has been received. This ensures your session time is reserved exclusively for you. You are welcome to cancel your session free of charge with at least 24 hours' notice. Cancellations made with less than 24 hours' notice are non-refundable. Refunds will also be issued if your therapist is unavailable, which is a rare occurrence. In that situation, you would be offered either a full refund for the session or the option to reschedule at no extra cost.",
    },
    {
      question: 'What should I do if I feel unable to keep myself safe?',
      answer:
        'If you ever feel like you might harm yourself, or that you are at risk from others, please do not wait and reach out for help immediately. Consider contacting one (or more) of the resources below, or seeking urgent help through your local emergency services, GP, or a trusted friend or family member.
